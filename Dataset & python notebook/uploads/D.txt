In  this  paper  we  measure  and  quantify  how consumer’s  choice  of  smartphones  are  related  to  their  peers’ smartphone  choices.  Specifically,  we  study  and  compare  this ‘social component’ of product adoption for two competing classes of  smartphones:    iPhone  and  Android.    This  is  done  by constructing  a  proxy  of  a  social  network  by  using  anonymous phone  log  data  from  Norwegian  mobile  phone  users,  and  then coupling  adoption  data  to  this  social  network.  We  find  that smartphone  adoption  is  dependent  on  the  underlying  social network both for Android and for  iPhone  users.  Comparing  the two, we see  that the effect  is  strongest for the latter. In  addition, we  measure  that  the  core  social  network  is  larger  for  iPhone users  than  for  Android  –  Measured  by  telecom communication, Apple  users  have  more  friends  than  android  users.  We  also present  results  showing  urban/rural  differences  in  smartphone usage.
It  has  long  been  known  among  marketers  that  our  social network matters when we make purchasing decisions, and  that having positive word of mouth about a product can be a key to success; see e.g. [1] for a review of studies  on social networks within marketing. Traditionally,  data  on  social  networks have been  difficult  to collect,  but  in recent  years  researchers have gained access to  massive  social network data  from e.g. online instant  messaging  services  [8][5]  and  phone  log  data [2][4][3][6][9].  Such  data  has  made  it  possible  to  study  e.g. social churn [3], service uptake [2] among telecom customers, and  product  adoption  on  an  Instant  Messaging  network [8].These studies confirm that consumer behavior is dependent on the communication network. We  have in a recent study [6] shown  how  the  structure  of  the  adopter  network—the  social network  of  adopters—develops  over  time,  and  how  social spreading  can  be  measured by  studying  this  network. In  this paper,  we  do  a  comparative study  of  social  spreading  effects for  two  competing  types  of smartphones  -  the  Apple  iPhone, and smartphones based on Google’s Android OS. Inspired  by these  results,  we  have  examined  the  geographic distributions  of  these  two products.  Our  method  here  was  to first  aggregate  Apple  and  Android  adoption  totals  over Norwegian postal codes, and then we take the ratio of the two. Figure 5 shows the results superimposed on a map of Norway. What  we  find,  very  simply,  is  that  Apple  is  dominating  in Norway’s  cities.  Since  these  results  are  also  from  Q3/2011, there  are  roughly  equal  numbers  of  Apple  and  Android phones—so that Apple cannot  win everywhere. Thus we see a rather stark urban/rural dichotomy, with Apple dominating the cities  and Android  turning  up  as scattered  blue  spots  in  the countryside.
